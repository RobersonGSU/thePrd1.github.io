			<p>Once you master the basics of authoring HTML&comma; you&rsquo;ll need focus on what your next steps will be. If you&rsquo;re an aspiring web designer&comma; you&rsquoe;ll need to dive deeper into HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. If you’re maintaining a corporate or personal site through a CMS, you’ll need to focus on how the CMS works, and the most efficient ways to edit and maintain content. On this page I&rsquo;ll give you some basic advice on how to approach learning web design and point you towards additional resources that can help you along the way.</p>

			<h3>Learning Web Design</h3>
			<p>&ldquo;Web design&rsquo;is a pretty open-ended term. Often people who are new to web design feel overwhelmed at everything there is to learn. That’s understandable, but just remember that it’s like any other discipline; with proper dedication and focus you’ll progress quickly. Here’s my favorite advice to new web designers on learning web design&colon;</p>
			<p><strong>Learn how the web works</strong></p>
			<p>I&rsquo;m always amazed at how many web designers focus on learning “just what they need to know” and ignore how the web actually works. Without understanding how web servers&comma; protocols, browsers, and other related web technology works&comma; you&rsquo;ll never really understand the context behind why you do the things you do, and what makes one practice better than another.</p>
			<p><strong>Never Stop Learning</strong></p>
			<p>The web is constantly evolving. Even if you become the absolute best there is in a specific field, chances are new techniques and approaches will come along within the year that will make your current skill set less desirable. Understand that being a good web designer means embracing the changing nature of the web.</p>
			<p><strong>Break things!</strong></p>
			<p>There is no better teacher than experience. Build and experiment constantly. Ask yourself, &ldquo;what would happen if I?...&rdquo; or &ldquo;wonder if I could build?...&rdquo; and then go out and build it. If you’re like me, you&rsquo;ll fail a good bit of the time, but the process of trying things and breaking them will make you that much better. Always challenge yourself.</p>
